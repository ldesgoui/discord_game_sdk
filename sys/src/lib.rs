//! This crate provides `bindgen`-generated bindings to the [Discord Game SDK].
//!
//! *This crate is not official, it is not supported by the Discord Game SDK Developers.*
//!
//! Following the `-sys` package conventions, this crate does not define higher-level abstractions.
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! discord_game_sdk_sys = "0.999.0"
//! ```
//!
//! Read up on potential [`bindgen` requirements].
//!
//! Download the [Discord Game SDK] and set the following environment variable to where you extracted it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! export DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH=/path/to/discord_game_sdk
//! ```
//!
//!
//! # Features:
//!
//! - `link`: (enabled by default)  
//!     Provides the linker with a copy of the dynamic library.  
//!     This allows for `cargo run` to run with no additional setup on Linux and Windows.
//!
