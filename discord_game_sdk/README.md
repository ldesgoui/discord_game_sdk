This crate provides a safe interface to the [Discord Game SDK].

*This crate is not official, it is not supported by the Discord Game SDK Developers.*

The [Discord Game SDK] provides features such as, but not limited to:

- Activities (Rich Presence)
- Users, Avatars and Relationships
- Lobbies, Matchmaking and Voice communication
- Faux-P2P Networking on Discord's Infrastructure
- Cloud Synchronized Storage
- Store Transactions
- Achievements

*Version requirement: Rust 1.37 and up.*

*[Release Notes](https://github.com/ldesgoui/discord_game_sdk/releases)*


## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
discord_game_sdk = "1.0.0-rc.3"
```

Read up on potential [`bindgen` requirements].

Download the [Discord Game SDK] and set the following environment variable to where you extracted it:

```sh
export DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH=/path/to/discord_game_sdk
```

If you're also planning on using the default `link` feature, keep reading below.


## Features:

#### `link`

Enabled by default, delegates to `discord_game_sdk_sys/link`.

Provides functional linking with the caveat that libraries are renamed and some additional
set-up is required:

```sh
# Linux: prepend with `lib` and add to library search path
cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/{,lib}discord_game_sdk.so
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}$DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64

# Mac OS: prepend with `lib` and add to library search path
cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/{,lib}discord_game_sdk.dylib
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}$DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64

# Windows: change `dll.lib` to `lib` (won't affect library searching)
cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/discord_game_sdk.{dll.lib,lib}
cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86/discord_game_sdk.{dll.lib,lib}
```

This allows for `cargo run` to function.


#### [`image`](https://docs.rs/image)

Optional crate.

Provides a conversion from our `Image` to `image::RgbaImage`.


## Safety

This crate relies on the SDK to provide correct data and behavior:

- Non-null pointers to valid memory
- UTF-8, NUL-terminated strings
- No mutation of memory it should have no ownership of
- No use of pointers after `destroy` is called

Some of these are tested when compiled with `debug_assertions`.
