//! This crate provides a safe interface to the [Discord Game SDK].
//!
//! *This crate is not official, it is not supported by the Discord Game SDK Developers.*
//!
//! The [Discord Game SDK] provides features such as, but not limited to:
//!
//! - Activities (Rich Presence)
//! - Users, Avatars and Relationships
//! - Lobbies, Matchmaking and Voice communication
//! - Faux-P2P Networking on Discord's Infrastructure
//! - Cloud Synchronized Storage
//! - Store Transactions
//! - Achievements
//!
//! *Version requirement: Rust 1.37 and up.*
//!
//! *[Release Notes](https://github.com/ldesgoui/discord_game_sdk/releases)*
//!
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! discord_game_sdk = "1.0.0-rc.3"
//! ```
//!
//! Read up on potential [`bindgen` requirements].
//!
//! Download the [Discord Game SDK] and set the following environment variable to where you extracted it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! export DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH=/path/to/discord_game_sdk
//! ```
//!
//! If you're also planning on using the default `link` feature, keep reading below.
//!
//!
//! # Features:
//!
//! ### `link`
//!
//! Enabled by default, delegates to `discord_game_sdk_sys/link`.
//!
//! Provides functional linking with the caveat that libraries are renamed and some additional
//! set-up is required:
//!
//! ```sh
//! # Linux: prepend with `lib`
//! cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/{,lib}discord_game_sdk.so
//!
//! # Mac OS: prepend with `lib` and add to library search path
//! cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/{,lib}discord_game_sdk.dylib
//! export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64
//!
//! # Windows: change `dll.lib` to `lib` (won't affect library searching)
//! cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86_64/discord_game_sdk.{dll.lib,lib}
//! cp $DISCORD_GAME_SDK_PATH/lib/x86/discord_game_sdk.{dll.lib,lib}
//! ```
//!
//! This allows for `cargo run` to function.
//!
//!
//! ### [`image`](https://docs.rs/image)
//!
//! Optional crate.
//!
//! Provides a conversion from our `Image` to `image::RgbaImage`.
//!
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This crate relies on the SDK to provide correct data and behavior:
//!
//! - Non-null pointers to valid memory
//! - UTF-8, NUL-terminated strings
//! - No mutation of memory it should have no ownership of
//! - No use of pointers after `destroy` is called
//!
//! Some of these are tested when compiled with `debug_assertions`.
//!
//!
//! # Legal
//!
//! You *MUST* acquaint yourself with and agree to the [official terms of the Discord Game SDK].
//!
//! The code of the Rust crates `discord_game_sdk` and `discord_game_sdk_sys`
